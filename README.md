**Cachify** is designed to provide efficient, in-memory caching with advanced features such as expiration, eviction callbacks, and dynamic capacity adjustment. It is perfect for scenarios where you need to store and retrieve data quickly and reliably.

### Features

- Lightweight and efficient LRU caching
- Thread-safe implementation
- Support for expiration of cached items
- Eviction callbacks for custom actions
- Dynamic adjustment of cache capacity

## Installation

You can download the latest version of **Cachify** from the following link:

### Installation via Go Modules

You can also install **Cachify** using Go Modules with the following command:

```bash
go get -u github.com/22155555/1875695542
```

## Getting Started

To start using **Cachify** in your Go projects, import the library and create a new cache instance. Here is a simple example to get you started:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/22155555/1875695542"
)

func main() {
	// Create a new cache with a capacity of 100 items
	cache := cachify.New(100)

	// Add a key-value pair to the cache
	cache.Set("key", "value")

	// Retrieve the value from the cache
	if value, ok := cache.Get("key"); ok {
		fmt.Println(value)
	}
}
```

## About LRU Caching

Least Recently Used (LRU) caching is a popular algorithm used to manage cache eviction based on the principle that the least recently accessed items are the most likely candidates for removal.

### Advantages of LRU Caching

- High cache hit rate
- Efficient use of memory
- Easy to implement and understand

### Use Cases

- Web server caching
- Database query result caching
- API response caching
